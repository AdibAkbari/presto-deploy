We put the Dashboard and Logout buttons at opposite ends of Navbar as it is a
 bad design choice ot have buttons with opposite actions in close proximity to
 one another. This was also done for the 'Save Changes' and 'Cancel' buttons
 in SlidesRearrange.jsx.

We found a red colour that would work with the blue colour present in the Navbar
 and some of the buttons in a Triad colour harmony. We added this to our theme.

We added icons to the buttons on the slide editing and slides rearranging pages
 so that the user can efficiently find the tools they need.
