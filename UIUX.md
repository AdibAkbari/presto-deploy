We put the Dashboard and Logout buttons at opposite ends of Navbar as it is a
 bad design choice ot have buttons with opposite actions in close proximity to
 one another. This was also done for the 'Save Changes' and 'Cancel' buttons
 in SlidesRearrange.jsx.

We found a red colour that would work with the blue colour present in the Navbar
 and some of the buttons in a Triad colour harmony. We added this to our theme.

We added icons to the buttons on the slide editing and slides rearranging pages
 so that the user can efficiently find the tools they need.

The Delete Slide button is red to contrast the other buttons on the edit slide page AppBar. We used a consistent colour (Black) with the rest of the buttons on this bar to reduce the user's distraction by the AppBar.

We added the delete presentation button to the AppBar when the screen size reached the
xs breakpoint to reduce the white space to the right of the menu icon and provide balance.

The buttons on the edit slide AppBar and the menu button that contains these buttons when
the screen gets smaller are arranged in the same order for familiarity. The user
does not have to adjust to a new order of buttons, allowing them to give the same
amount of attention to editing the presentation across all screen sizes.
