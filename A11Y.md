We added a button linked to the register page below the login form so users without an account can create one more easily.

We added tooltips to all the AppBar buttons and on the Delete Presentation and 
edit presentation title buttons. Tooltips improve usability and provide alternative text 
to users with visual impairment issues. They also help new users find their 
way around the app more efficiently.

We also added icons to streamline onboarding and also make it easier for regular users 
to find the tool they needed. Icons were added to all buttons on the slides rearranging 
and slide edit page.

We avoided using alerts as these provide a disruptive experience for those using 
screenreaders. We used modals to show errors instead.

When a user is editing an element or the theme of the presentation, changes are 
not made until the save button is pressed. This makes the website more predictable and 
provides a relaxed user expereience.

The Tab key can be used to navigate between all buttons and inputs across the app. This is 
good for users who cannot or perfer not to use a mouse.

All image elements on slides have an alternate text.

All the colour contrast ratios for text against background are 4.65:1 or more. They all pass 
the AA standard.

TO ensure our code was robust, all open tags had an equivalent close tag and all self-closing 
tags had a trailing slash.

ARIA tags were sometimes used in the code. They provide further information in addition to HTML
 to assistive technologies, allowing a broader range of users to access our app and its tools.
